## üìò Project Description

This project is a real-time wireless environmental monitoring system built using **ESP32 microcontrollers**, multiple **air and water quality sensors**, and a **Unity 3D simulation** to visualize live data.

It consists of:
- üü¢ **Green Node**: Monitors air quality (MQ2, MQ135, Dust, DHT11, LDR)
- üîµ **Aqua Node**: Monitors water quality (TDS, Water Level, Temperature Probe)
- üì∂ **Relay**: Forwards data from both nodes using ESP-NOW protocol
- üñ•Ô∏è **Receiver**: Sends received data to Unity for simulation via Serial

Unity responds with:
- Smoke, colored particles, water tank fill level, day/night effects  
- Audio alerts (`.wav` files) based on pollution or water contamination
